Hash Table
===========

Advantages
###########

-> Hashtable is a datastructure that offers VERY FAST INSERTION AND SEARCHING
-> Hashtables are significantly faster than trees.
-> No only they are fast, they are relatively easy to program.
-> If we don't need to visit the items in order and you can predict in advance the size of the database
   Hashtables are unparalleled in speed in convenience.

Disadvantages
##############

-> Hashtable are based on arrays and they are difficult to expand once they are created.
-> For some kind of Hashtables performance will degrade catastrophically when the table becomes too full. So the programmer
   needs to have fairly accurate idea of how many data items will need to be stored ( or be prepared periodically transfer data
   to a larger hashtable which is a time consuming process)
-> No convenient way to visit the hashtable in any kind of order ( from smallest to largest)
