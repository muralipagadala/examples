Generics : my study notes.
==========================
=> Generics enable TYPES ( Classes and Interfaces ) to be parameterized when defining classes, interface, and methods.
=> Much like more familiar formal parameters used in method declarations.
=> Type parameters provide a way for you to reuse the source code with different input.
