If you process a collection, you may want to write a method that
	-> Can do "something" for every element of the list
	-> Can do "something else" when you finish processing the list
	-> Can do "yet something else" if you encounter an error
This what behavior parameterization refers to.

Here’s an analogy: your room mate knows how to drive to the supermarket and back home. 
So you can tell him to buy a list of things such as bread, cheese, and wine. 
This is equivalent to calling a method goAndBuy with a list of products as argument.

But one day you’re at the office and you need him to do something he’s never done 
before: pick up a package from the post office. You now need to pass him a list of 
instructions: 
	go to the post office, 
	use this reference number, 
	talk to the manager, 
	and pick up the parcel.

You could pass him the list of instructions by email, and when he receives it, he can go ahead and follow the instructions.

You’ve now done something a bit more advanced that’s equivalent to a method: 
go, which can take different new behaviors as arguments and execute them.
