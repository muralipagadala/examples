-> Java compiler deduces what functional interface to associate with a lambda expression from its surrounding context aka target type.
   meaning it can also deduce appropriate signature for the lambda because the function descriptor is available through the target type.
   
   The benefit is that the compiler has access to the types of the parameters of a lambda expresion, and they can be omitted in the lambda
   syntax
   
   In other words, the Java compiler infers the types of the parameters of a lambda as shown below.
