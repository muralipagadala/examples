What functional interfaces would you use for the following function descriptors 
(that is, signatures of a lambda expression)? 
As a further exercise, come up with valid lambda expressions that you can use with these functional
interfaces.

1. T -> R
2. (int, int) -> int
3. T -> void
4. () -> T
5. (T, U) -> R



1. Function<T, R> : it has only one abstract method with functional descriptor as : R apply(T)
2. IntBinaryOperator
3. Consumer<T> : void accept(T)
4. Supplier<T>, Callable<T> both has function descriptor as () -> T
5. BiFunction<T,U,R> : (T,U) -> R
