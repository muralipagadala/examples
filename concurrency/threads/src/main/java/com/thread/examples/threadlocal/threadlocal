ThreadLocal
-----------

-> The purpose of ThreadLocal is to bind an Object to a thread which has two distinct and useful consequences.
-> The object is not shared between threads so it can be used without the synchronization. And the object
   is available through out the life time of a Thread, meaning we don't have to pass the object all over the
   places through method calls.
-> ThreadLocal has advantages in common with both local variable and global variables.
