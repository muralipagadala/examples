-> create  program to take the input and process it. This program must be able to process multiple request at the same time. It should take the input
and spawn a thread to process the Task and main thread should be available to take the input and process new thread. 

Then put a constraint to limit to 5 thread. If there are no threads available wait for the threads to complete before spawing a new one.

--> Can you create a program to take the typed input and save it in a different thread

--> I am thinking like thread create means allocate memory, resource like thread's own stack, local memory, program counter, stack pointer.
    And once the thread is created, it could be waiting for a chance to be executed by CPU. Here is the confusion all the texts says thread executes the code
    is it correct? How can thread executes the code. Only CPU executes any thing. Probably, thread is pointer like ThreadId for the CPU to start execution.
    
 --> I guess application code is different from thread code. Which work to be done and should be in the Runnable. Thread is an engine to process/execute the
     Runnables which is work to be done. In Java, Thread is handler which provides useful handles/interface to interact with engine. We cannot include actual
     work in the engine itself.
     
 --> When we call Thread.stop(), does thread stop it self or CPU stops executing the thread?
